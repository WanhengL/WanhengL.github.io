## Viz 1: Count of Bigfoot records by season and classification

<vegachart schema-url="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/json/bigfootSeason.json" style="width: 100%"></vegachart>

This plot represents the number of Bigfoot records in each season, with each season's data further segmented into classifications A, B, and C. A selection tool is available to focus on a specific range of seasons and examine the breakdown of classifications within that range, which is updated on the chart on the right. Both charts are bar charts with the X-axis representing nominal data (N) for the seasons and the Y-axis quantitatively encoding (Q) the count of sightings.

The chart on the left is from  HW 7. As stated in HW 7, the colors are chosed because they're my undergraduate university's colors and they're easy to tell apart from each other. But I created and linked the chart on the right for this homework. This is because the number of Classification C records is substantially lower than those of A and B, rendering its representation on the left chart less visible. The selection tool allows to focus on specific seasons(s) and depict classification types on a log scale for better visibility.

## Viz 2: Bigfoot location in the US

<vegachart schema-url="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/json/bigfootMap.json" style="width: 100%"></vegachart>

This plot features the location of each Bigfoot record on a US map. A base map of the US and capitals are added for reference. This plot also from HW 7. However, I rewrote vega-lite specialization in the Altair way. A tooltip is also added to show specific lantitude and longitude in case of any interest. Longitude and latitude are encoded as Q (quantitative) and city names are encoded as N.
